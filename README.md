Welcome to Allay! We are a platform that aims to relieve stress for students by providing a message board where students and alumni can talk about their job seeking experience. We do this by allowing alumni to leave reviews, post about job interviews, and share salaries. Additionally, we aim to provide basic social networking between students and hired alumni.

Allay is a job portal for Lambda students and alumni to network and talk about their place of employment, hiring process, and salary range.
